# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage
**Range.RangeIntersectsTest**
Before adding test case Range.intersectsWithReverse(), the coverage calculated using EclEmma was as mentioned in the below table.
| Counter    | Coverage   |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Statement | 100 %  |
| Branches   |   87.5 %  |
| Lines  |   100 %  |
| Methods   | 100 %|    
| Complexity   |   80 %  |

Although we have reached the minimum coverage of 70% coverage for the branch, we can still find ways to improve this coverage.

When we analyzed our test code coverage using EclEmma, we found that the following condition is only partially covered

return (b0 < this.upper && b1 >= b0);

We have found that the branch that we did not cover is when b0 > b1.

To improve on the coverage, we have added the test case intersectsWithReverse() where we called the intersects method with the values -6, -9 respectively so that b0 (-6) is greater than b1 (-9).

With the addition of this test case, all metrics have coverage of 100%, as again calculated using EclEmma.

After adding test case Range.intersectsWithReverse(), the coverage calculated using EclEmma was as mentioned in the below table.
| Counter    | Coverage   |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Statement | 100 %  |
| Branches   | 100 %  |
| Lines  |   100 %  |
| Methods   | 100 %|    
| Complexity   |   80 %  |
